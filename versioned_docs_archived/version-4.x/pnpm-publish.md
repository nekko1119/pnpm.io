Publishes a package to the registry.

```
pnpm publish [<tarball>|<folder>] [--tag <tag>] [--access <public|restricted>]
```

When publishing a package inside a [workspace](workspace.md), the LICENSE file from the
root of the workspace is packed with the package (unless the package has a license of its own).

## --tag \<tag>

Publishes the package with the given tag. By default, `pnpm publish` updates the `latest` tag.

For example:

```sh
# inside the foo package directory
pnpm publish --tag next
# in a project where you want to use the next version of foo
pnpm add foo@next
```

## --access \<public|restricted>

Tells the registry whether the published package should be public or restricted.

## package.json publishConfig

Added in: v3.4.0

It is possible to override some fields in the manifest, before the package is packed.
The following fields may be overriden: `typings`, `types`, `main` and `module`.
To override a field, add the publish version of the field to `publishConfig`.

For instance, the following `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "foo",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "src/index.ts",
  "publishConfig": {
    "main": "lib/index.js",
    "typings": "lib/index.d.ts"
  }
}
```

Will be published as:

```json
{
  "name": "foo",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "lib/index.js",
  "typings": "lib/index.d.ts"
}
```
